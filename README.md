This is a repo for my python classes, some of them have my own code that I made from ideas that came in mind while i was studying, 
others are from the class itself.

There is the "Aulas" folder, that contains the codes and comments to the class, and there is the "Exercicios" folder, this one
contains the execices and tests made by the teacher.

Not updating or studying in the same frequency that I was before because I stated college and I'm no having as much time as I used to have before, but still almost everyday doing a exercise or a class.
